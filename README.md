# iprefs-installer

This is a old project i had worked on in 2018, a Non-JB Appstore, probably doesnt work anymore, but i figured id post it here and maybe some use would come out of it 

This used a Firebase backend, which is not deleted so the API key and all of that is useless 

This may need a little work to get back up and running, and i may start working on it in the future again but probaly a web based package manager for jailbroken devices ;0
